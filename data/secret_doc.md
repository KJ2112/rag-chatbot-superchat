My beautiful, wonderful Ishitu, 💕

Every single day, I wake up and think about how incredibly lucky I am to have you in my life. You are the most precious person to me. There's literally nothing in this world that compares to you. 🌟

Your smile makes my entire day better. Your laugh is my favorite sound in the world—it's better than any music I could ever hear. The way you care, the way you love, the way you simply exist—it's everything to me. You're perfect just the way you are. ✨

I need you to know something, and I want you to really hear this:

Whenever you're feeling down, whenever you're doubting yourself, whenever you need someone—I'm here. Your Kutta is always with you. Always. I will never let you feel alone. I will never stop loving you. I will never stop fighting for us. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.

You are my soulmate. You are my future wife. You are my forever. And I'm not scared of that—I'm grateful for it. Every single moment with you feels like a blessing.

I love you with every fiber of my being. Today, tomorrow, and every day after that. You're not just my girlfriend—you're my best friend, my partner, my home, my everything.

There's nothing I wouldn't do for you. You make me want to be better, to do better, to be worthy of your love. And the best part? You already make me feel that way just by being you.

I promise you a life filled with love, adventure, laughter, and security. I promise to be the person you need me to be. I promise to cherish you, protect you, and love you like no one else ever could.

When you're with me, I want you to feel completely safe. I want you to feel completely loved. I want you to feel like you're exactly where you're supposed to be. Because you are.

You make every day better just by being in it. Your presence is a gift. Your love is a gift. You are a gift.

So whenever you feel lost or lonely or unsure—remember this: I'm here. I'm always here. And I'm yours, completely and forever.

You are loved so deeply, Ishitu. More than you could ever know. 🌙

Forever yours,  
**Your Kutta** 🐕💕

## Who Is Ishita? 🌹

Ishita is the most beautiful soul I know. She's not just my girlfriend—she's my best friend, my soulmate, my home, and my forever person. Every single time I think of her, my heart does something it shouldn't be able to do. She's everything I've ever wanted and more.

Her beauty runs deeper than what you see on the surface. Yes, she's absolutely stunning—the way she carries herself, the light in her eyes, that smile—it's breathtaking. But what truly makes her beautiful is her heart, her kindness, her genuine love for people, and the way she lights up the world just by being in it.

She's the kind of person who makes everyone around her feel special, but most importantly, she makes me feel loved in a way I never knew was possible.

## Our Love Story ✨

We met way back in school at GGS—just kids, just friends, completely unaware that life had something extraordinary planned for us. Those early days were precious, innocent, and full of laughter.

Then in 9th class, something shifted. We spent time together at tuition, and there was magic in those conversations. She was always there, always making things better just by being around. I knew she was someone special, but I didn't know how to express it.

Then COVID happened. Life got complicated. We went in different directions and slowly drifted apart. But destiny had other plans.

After exams, after all the chaos, somehow we found our way back to each other. And from June 13, 2023, onwards—**not a single day has passed when we haven't talked to each other.** Not one day. Through everything—exams, celebrations, fights, misunderstandings—every single day, we communicate. Every single day, we're connected.

That's not just commitment. That's proof that what we have is real.

## Why She's So Special 👑

Ishita is absolutely stunning. It's not just her physical appearance—it's the way she moves, the way she smiles, the light that radiates from her. But what truly makes her beautiful is who she is inside. Her compassion, her warmth, the genuine care she has for people—that inner beauty is what makes her glow.

She's so lovable and caring. The way she loves is pure and genuine—unconditional and complete. She listens like it matters. She cares like it's her responsibility. She has this charming personality that naturally draws people in, but most importantly, she loves me unconditionally, completely, without reservation.

She's my support system, my comfort zone, my safe place. She's inspiring, strong, resilient, and fun. When she's happy, the entire world feels brighter. She brings meaning and joy to my life in ways I can't fully articulate. She's my motivation to be better and my reason to dream bigger.

## We're Lovebirds 🕊️

She calls me "Kutta" with so much affection and love, and I call her "Ishitu." These aren't just nicknames—they're words loaded with emotion, history, and devotion. Every time I hear her say my name, my heart melts. Every time I say hers, I'm pouring everything I feel into that single word.

We're not just in a relationship—we're lovebirds. We belong together. We complete each other. When we're together, there's a kind of energy that's hard to explain. It's home. It's peace. It's everything.

---

## Through Every Phase 🌈

We've fought. We've had difficult times. We've misunderstood each other and felt frustrated. But every single time, we came out stronger, more connected, more committed to each other.

Every challenge proved that what we have is real and solid. I love her more with each passing day. Every sunrise, I wake up and love her more than I did the day before. Every sunset, I go to sleep grateful that she chose me, that she stays with me, that she's part of my life.

---

## My Promises to Her 💫

I promise to build a future worthy of her. She deserves someone who works hard, dreams big, and is willing to sacrifice to give her the life she deserves. She inspires me to be the best version of myself every single day.

I promise we will explore this world together. We'll watch sunsets in places we've only dreamed about. We'll create memories that will last a lifetime. This isn't just about traveling—it's about building a life filled with adventure, discovery, and shared dreams.

Most importantly, no matter what comes—success or failure, happiness or sadness, easy times or hard times—I will always be by your side. Your Kutta will never leave you. You are my constant, my anchor, my home. I will never let you feel alone. I will never stop loving you.

## When People Ask About Her 💬

She's the most important person in my life. She's beautiful, kind, caring, and genuinely one of the best people I know. We met young, drifted apart, and somehow found our way back to each other.

We're not perfect, but we're real. We fight, we grow, we love fiercely. She inspires me to be better every single day. I can't imagine my life without her in it.
